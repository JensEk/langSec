# Getting started 

1. Identifiers have already been generated - you may not need to create them. 
   Generate   identifiers `make create-network-identifiers`. This needs to be
   done just once. This command will also generate an alias file that 
   will be used by the server and the individual clients. 

2. Start the server `make myserver`

3. For each of the clients alice, start a new terminal
   session, and start the corresponding client by running 
  `make client-alice`, etc. The client for Bob is not provided with
   the solution but is similar to client for Alice.

4. Terminate each troupe program by pressing "Ctrl+C".
